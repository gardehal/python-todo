## My Thoughts

I wanted a way to manage some tasks I had to do (henceforth "TODOs") that sometime repeaded daily and the mental list got out of hand. I needed a way to write them down and keep them handy without having to plaster my wall with post-it notes, which is why I though about making this program. I am aware that there are programs like this out there, as with some of the other projects I have done, but I need some specific functions to help me manage my lists. 

This is not the first time I've made a TODO list, but the previous one is dated and it would be more work and less beneficial rewriteing the old code (PHP). I was unsure what language to choose for this project, but I'm going with Python as I enjoy writeing it and have no need for a online version just yet. I did consider learning Ember or Vue or something similar to cultivate my frontend skills, and might redo this project with that in the future.

### TODO:
- check spelling
- tests
- when deleteing last task in list a blank line remains
